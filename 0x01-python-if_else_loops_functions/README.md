# Python - if/else,loops & functions
	each file contains code that illustrates an essential concept of python: if/elif/else loops, range, ord(), chr(), modulo, copy of string, bytecode, etc

*NB. All files are python scripts except #13*

0. Print whether the random number is positive or negative
1. Print the last digit of the number stored in prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line variable
2. Prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line
3. Print the alphabets in lowercase, not followed by a new line
4. Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
5. Prints numbers 0 to 99
6. Prints all possible different combinations of two digits
7. Function that checks for lowercase character
8. Function that prints a string in uppercase  followed by a new line
9. Function that prints the last digit of a number
10. function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value
11. Function that prints the numbers form 1 to 100 separated by a space - FizzBuzz
12. Function in c that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
13. Prints the alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase), not followed by anew line
14. Function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n(not the Python way, the "C array index")
